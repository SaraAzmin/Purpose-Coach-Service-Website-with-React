I always plan ahead to have a clear idea of what tasks I need to accomplish, how much time should be invested into it.  Also, instead of multi tasking, I prefer to fo one thing at a time. In that way my concentration is not devided into parts and I can think of multiple solution of one specific problem at a time. Working hard results better when one works smart as well. I have been using these tricks and will be using in future to achieve the goals I cherish.  </p>
